## Recommendations for Landing Page Updates

### Statistics That Should Be Updated:

1. **"15,000+ Marine Species at risk"** → Change to:
   - "88 Marine Species Officially at Risk" (COSEWIC/SARA listed)
   - OR "Over 800 Marine Species Globally Affected by Plastic Pollution"

2. **Pollution Breakdown Percentages** → Update to Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup data:
   - Cigarette butts: 19%
   - Plastic bottles/caps: 15-18%
   - Food wrappers: 12%
   - Fishing gear: 6-10%

3. **"700+ Threatened Marine Species"** → Change to:
   - "88 Marine Species at Risk in Canada" (official COSEWIC count)
   - OR keep as general stat about global species affected

### Statistics That Are Accurate:
- ✅ Canada's coastline: 243,042 km
- ✅ Global ocean plastic: 8 million tons annually
- ✅ Seabirds with plastic: 90%
- ✅ North Atlantic right whale: ~350 individuals
- ✅ Ghost gear: 10% of ocean plastic
