# WaveGuard Data Integrity Guide

## Overview

WaveGuard is committed to presenting accurate, verified data about ocean pollution and marine conservation. This guide documents our approach to data integrity and provides information about our data sources.

## Data Standards

All statistics presented on the WaveGuard platform adhere to the following standards:

### 1. **Source Verification**
- All data must be traceable to reputable sources
- Acceptable sources include:
  - Government agencies (federal, provincial)
  - Peer-reviewed scientific journals
  - Established conservation organizations
  - International scientific bodies (UN, UNEP, etc.)

### 2. **Currency**
- Statistics should be current (within 3-5 years)
- Annual review of key metrics
- Update when new data becomes available

### 3. **Accuracy**
- Conservative estimates when ranges exist
- Clear distinction between Canadian and global data
- Proper context for all statistics

### 4. **Transparency**
- All sources documented and accessible
- Clear labeling of data origin (e.g., "per COSEWIC", "Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup")
- Public access to source documentation
